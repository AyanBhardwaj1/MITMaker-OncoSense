# MITMaker-OncoSense
Arduino IDE Code for OncoSense Functionalities - For the MIT Maker Portfolio

AdaSpecCode was for testing on skin lesions, bumps, scars, and further anomalies alongside moisture. It is developed however still not well-tested. 
MainSkin is the code used in the video, the main code used to detect skin moisture and classifying it as dry, normal, or well-hydrated.
